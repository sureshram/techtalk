    - Shards - Strategy might change 
    - Random Forest - need more data
  - Answer
    - In-memory, unlimited core, standard hardware
* Future of Data Science
 From 2017 - companies need to use machine learning

analytics
research insights

- Term Frequency, Dendogram (clustering technigque), 
- correlation is called association text analytics

Data Monsters
--------------
Problem with chatbot
 - Do you want 
    - bot: coffee or tea?
    - human: water please or coffee is bad for me
 - after 10 phrases 90% of customers will say it's dump     
 - Answer - Knowledge Mining 
          - topic modeling algorithms 
             - PLSA - Hoffman 1999 - Probablistic Latent Semantic Analysic - not so good
             - now LDA is famous
             - problem with both are results are not interpretable
             - data monster use ARTM - additive regularization for topic modeling
